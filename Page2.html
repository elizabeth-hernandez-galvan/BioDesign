<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Trauma victims experience situations that can compromise not only their physiology. They might be put in situations that expose them to the natural elements without proper protection or require an immediate source of protection after a traumatic event. Temperature regulation is an important factor when addressing trauma patients as both hypothermia and trauma are highly correlated. This is important to address as hypothermia could be the underlying cause of a larger health issue and is a leading cause of death in trauma victims. Trauma, as well as environment exposure, blood loss, and injuries can impair the ability to self regulate temperature. Signs of hypothermia such as shivering, decreasing heart rate, and decreasing rate of respiration, are also symptoms of trauma itself. If left unattended, hypothermia can become fatal for a trauma patient. This makes it essential for medics to recognize hypothermia in trauma victims. However, recognizing is not enough: ensuring that the patient is provided effective assistance in temperature regulation has equal importance to other life saving measures. While current emergency blankets provide the feeling of protection, they are not a source of heat, may be non-reusable, or are made in environmentally unsustainable processes, and do not provide a specific response catered to the needs of every user. Based on this issue, our team has proposed a solution to provide a source of prevention and immediate protection in response to hypothermia, especially in trauma victims. We propose to create a transformable blanket-to-jacket wearable made from a textile that can recognize a person's body temperature and respond with a heating system based on the needs of the user. Made from the highly flexible, lightweight, and insulating aerogel phase change composite, and covered by agar bioplastic, this textile would be a more sustainable, heat efficient biocompatible alternative for warming tools used by medical response teams and civilians in vulnerable situations. It is made from more environmentally
sustainable materials that require less raw materials to create, go through safer production processes, and can break down at the end of its life cycle. With this project, our design can lead to more sustainable products that incorporate biological materials and provide an accessible source of medical support.<br></p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In the United States, trauma is the leading cause of death for people ages one through forty four (Table of Causes of Death). Trauma can result from a myriad of trauamatic events and experiences, including but not limited to illness, rape, natural disasters, or a severe physical injury. In the case of severe bodily injuries, trauma victims are at a high risk for developing hypothermia, defined as the condition where an individual loses body heat faster than they can produce heat (Soreide, 2014). This increases the likelihood of death even more in comparison to normothermic victims. This is due to what medical professionals refer to as the "trauma triad of death" or the "Lethal Triad of Trauma," a positive feedback loop of blood clotting, acidosis, and hypothermia (Trauma Triad of Death, 2020)). As an individual starts to bleed, they start to process more glucose faster, which leads to increased acid in the bloodstream and lower heart performance. This diminished cardiac output then leads to a redistribution of blood flow that causes hypothermia (Wilson et al., 2011). The lower body temperature creates a loss of blood coagulation, continuing to give the triad more momentum. <em>See Figure 1.</em><br></p>

</p>

<p>On a cellular level, trauma-induced shock results in oxygen transport and tissue oxygenation being compromised (anaerobic metabolism) which then reduces the level of ATP synthesis, leading to the decreased hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. As a result, there is a decrease in heat production (Soreide, 2014). These symptoms of trauma in severely injured and bleeding patients disrupt the normal mechanisms of temperature regulation (i.e., muscle shivering to generate heat and sweating to remove excess heat). In the case of hypothermia, there is a lower hypothalamic temperature threshold to cue muscle shivering, which results in either slight shivering or no shivering at all (Soreide, 2014). Consequently, once a patient or victim reaches less than 36 degrees Celcius in core body temperature, they fall into a hypothermic state. In the case that a victim is able to receive medical help, there are many risk factors for inducing hypothermia from being found on-site by an emergency medical response team (EMS), during transportation to a hospital, during admission to the hospital and work-ups, and then in
surgery if needed. It takes on average 60 minutes for a trauma victim to be transported from the scene of the incident to the hospital (Lapostelle, 2017), and during this time there is a potential for ongoing bleeding and shock, exposure to potentially harmful environments, I.V. fluids, and medications that all can increase the risk of hypothermia or aggravate it.<em> See Figure 2. (Soreide, 2014)</em></p>

<p>Currently, EMS teams take responsive measures to address hypothermia, which include passive external rewarming techniques like removing cold or wet clothing and moving the patient to a warmer environment, or active core rewarming (warm I.V. fluid infusions, heated humidified oxygen, body cavity lavage, extracorporeal blood warming) and active external rewarming, using blankets for insulation (exact tools will be discussed later on in the solution) (Soreide, 2014). Passive rewarming modalities are most effective for shivering, mildly hypothermic patients, while active rewarming is necessary for non-shivering patients (Haverkamp et al., 2018). Even with a myriad of warming techniques, EMS teams are still faced with two problems when it comes to addressing hypothermia in trauma patients. For one, temperature measurement is not
streamlined and the accuracy of some measurement tools is questionable. In the emergency department, core temperature is best measured in the bladder, rectum, or esophagus using a temperature probe, but these methods are quite invasive and may not be efficient during emergency situations. Second, there is inconsistent documentation of temperature measurements for trauma victims. In a major trauma centre in London, body temperature was only recorded for 38% of their trauma patients on admission (Langhelle et al., 2012). This missing information is quite common in trauma databases, and temperature is too often not considered a core data point in trauma victims. This is alarming, when it is estimated that 2/3 trauma patients develop hypothermia (Lapostelle, 2017).</p>
<p>Studies show that prehospital management is a critical phase for mitigating hypothermia in trauma patients to decrease their susceptibility to death. This includes initial medical contact on scene and during transport. It is recommended that early temperature monitoring should be practiced (Keane, 2016) in order to improve emergency response and outcomes. Studies have also revealed the effectiveness of using both passive warming methods (blankets) and active rewarming, one study reporting that passive warming was effective in decreasing cold discomfort on the way to the hospital, and that active rewarming applied to the torso significantly improved thermal comfort and in some cases reduced the cold induced stress response (Lundgren et al., 2011). These insights will be critical in developing the structure and characteristics of our textile.</p>

<h1>Current Products</h1>
<p>As of now, the only way to help individuals suffering from hypothermia is to warm the body back to a normal core temperature of 98.6^F or 37^C through passive warming or active rewarming methods as stated in our background. To expand, the typical protocol taken by EMS teams includes moving the individuals to warmer environments and removing their wet clothing (Hypothermia, 2021). From there they should be covered with blankets or other warming methods and to insulate them from the cold ground (Hypothermia, 2021). You can use warm, dry compresses and warm beverages or I.V. Fluids to help the process along (Hypothermia, 2021). Technology has been developed to assist with hypothermia and focus on retaining and increasing body heat.</p>

<p>Current similar products include passive methods such as the Heatsheet blankets. Thermoresponsive textiles that are currently in the works include smart textiles, a temperature regulating fabric, and coated fibre amongst others.  <em>See Figure 3.</em></p>

</p>  
<p>There are always drawbacks to the current methods and these include a lack of a streamlined method for temperature sensing that would allow for documentation of temperature in trauma patients, a thermoregulative textile that is also durable and reusable, a sustainable and adjustabie cheap product amongst other things. Most importantly, it is important that this product would improve the efficiency of response to trauma victims hypothermia and assist medical response teams in treating them on scene, during prehospital management to increase resilience. <br><br>
Therefore, there is a need for a convenient, reusable and thermoresponsive method of hypothermic prevention to help trauma victims protect themselves. It will also allow for emergency response teams to more efficiently assist victims in disastrous events or environments. We want to create a smart textile that responds to temperature changes either by detecting the body temperature of the individual or the temperature of the environment. Our extreme users would be trauma victims in vulnerable situations with severe injuries and the medical team that is attending to those victims. The textile can still be applicable to average users and non-urgent situations.</p>
