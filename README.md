# BioDesign Website
As part of the biodesign challenge (https://biodesignchallenge.org/bdc-2021) my team (Maya Vargas, Edeline Anthoniraj, Vania Sutandi, 

and I) created a sustainable solution - Thermal Revival - for helping people prone to hypothermia. I created a website with more 

information about our design, research, and ideation process.
