    In our initial design process, our focus group was sexual assault survivors and individuals at risk for assault. We wanted to create a product that would protect and assist individuals in a situation where they were at risk of bodily harm. For example, we discussed the possibility of a textile that would toughen up when external force was applied, or a textile that was tough and uncuttable from the exterior but tearable from the inside. After some time, we realized that while we wanted to help sexual assault survivors and individuals at risk for assault, a protective product was both too broad of a solution and could reinforce the idea that sexual assault is the fault or responsibility of the victim. Through our disccusions, we concluded that social norm change would be more effective than a product when it comes to addressing rape culture. At that time we recalled that we had come across some research about trauma and its effect on individuals. We knew that there was a lot that happened with individuals suffering from physical trauma and that if we focused our efforts there, that we could still center on using protective and responsive textiles to help trauma victims.<br><br>

<h3>Week 1 </h3>
<div class="week1">

  <div class="wk1">
    <br>
    During week one, we continued our resource process and started our layout for the website. We also began the process of making the aerogel by shredding paper. However, due to restrictions in using the food and science lab, we could not continue the use of the paper since the ink could affect food products. Instead we moved towards buying the cellulose and using that to make the aerogel.

  <div class="wk2">
    <br>
    We interviewed a couple people this week in order to get a better understanding of both the product design and effectiveness. We talked to Nathan Marley, a Paramedic, and asked him questions on how our product would contribute to his job and any problem that would be associated with it. We also talked to Professor Hsieh about the materials we were using to design the product and talked about design ideas.

<h3>Week 3</h3>
<div class="week3">

  <div class="wk3">
    <br>
    We started sketching logo ideas and created our instagram page. We also began planning out our video and what we wanted to include. We also continued to further our research focus on the most important components to include in our presentation.<br>(Note: Click on logo to see our instagram page)

    We did some experiments on agar bioplastic recipes. We based our recipes from online sources and adjusted it based on how much flexibility, quantity, and thickness we wanted. We are aiming to make a sample that is flexible enough to be folded and sewed into a blanket and jacket. We wanted it to be as thin and strong as possible to mimic the feel of fabric.

<h3>Week 5</h3>
<div class="week5">

  <div class="wk5">
    <br>
    We started to film short clips to include in our video and revised our slideshow for the presentation. We also had a chance to practice presenting our project and hear about other projects our peers are working on.

  <div class="wk6">
   <br>
    We explored speculative design and what future our product could have. This included expanding into infrastructure and other emergency uses such as equipment for firefighters. We also considered how our product could be adapted to extreme sports and looked at further prototyping such as adding specialized layers. There was also a good amount of headway with our final video, digital prototyping, and we finalized our mission statement.

<h3>Week 7</h3>
<div class="week7">

  <div class="wk7">
    <br>
    The supplies for the aerogel arrived and therefore we immediately began prototype planning with schedules and coordinating lab work. We created content for our Instagram specifically about user needs and feedback from a textiles researcher. Finally, we presented our story with Thermal Revival to our fellow competitors to get feedback and learn about what worked and what didn't.

  <div class="wk8">
   <br>
    We started and finished making our cellulose hydrogels and began the coordination needed to freeze-dry the samples. We also completed our agar bioplastic and tested out its properties. We finalized our video format and goals. Finally, we created and discussed our end goals and finished creating content for our Instagram. 
    <br><br>

<h3>Week 9</h3>
<div class="week9">

  <div class="wk9">
    <br>
    Our final week! We put together the finishing touches, finished up prototyping with cellulose aerogel, and finished our website, social media, and video. We can't wait to compete and show all our hard work! We wish the best of luck to all the other teams as well!
